# The Problem

There are many useful open source machine learning models that are used to generate pictures, text, etc, but there are not many machine learning tools that can speed up the averyage mechanical engineer's workflow 

There are some that convert drawings to mech models etc. but they often output files that are difficult to work with precisely. 

# The Goal:

Create a machine learning model that can convert a hand sketch into a edditable .step 3d model.

# The Plan:

Use existing tools to make drawings from step files to build a dataset of models and their respective drawings. Train a model to make Step files from those drawings.
